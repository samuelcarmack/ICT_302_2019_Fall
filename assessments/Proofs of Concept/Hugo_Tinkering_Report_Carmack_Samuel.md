## Content Changes

Content changes I made to the class Hugo Website include changing the picture on the main page of the site by chnaging the link the code referenced and deleating the link to and icon of a social media site (I don't remeber which one). I also edited small protions of the *About Me* text with several additions

## Presentation Changes 

Presentation changes I made included changing the color of a link and making the entire page small by changing the maximum pixles length and width the page could be displayed on. 

# What Did You Learn?

Before this activity I had a deffinition of what content was and expierence with creating and editing content, but I had never thought about the process of what I was doing with that deffenition in mind. I also was aware of websites being stored in files, but I did not know that differents parts of a website could be stored in different areas that are additionaly stored on a larger template. Another thought I had not considered is how much impact a few small changes to presentation could have on an entire website. While Hugo is not a fully functional CMS, I do now understand how compartmentalizing different parts of a website could be extreemly helpfull when editing the site. I imagine an actual CMS would have broader oppertunities for changing both presentation and content, but also comes with the drawback of having more oppertunities to disrupt the site. One thing I wished I had learned is the best way or a good starting point for organizing files for a new site.
